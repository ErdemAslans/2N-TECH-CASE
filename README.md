## Notifications

### Triggers
- **Low Annual Leave Notification**: Employees with less than 3 days of annual leave trigger a notification to authorized personnel.
- **Tardiness Notification**: If an employee is late for work, a notification is sent to the authorized personnel.

---

## Email Configuration
Configure email settings in `settings.py`:

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your_email@example.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your_password'
```

---

## Usage

### Employee Workflow
1. Employees can log in via `/hesaplar/login/`.
2. They can view their remaining annual leave days on the dashboard.
3. Employees can submit leave requests, which are sent to authorized personnel for approval.

### Authorized Personnel Workflow
1. Authorized personnel log in via the same login page.
2. They can view pending leave requests and approve or reject them.
3. Notifications are sent for employee tardiness or insufficient leave days.
4. They can view monthly reports summarizing employee attendance and tardiness.

---

## Future Enhancements
- **Asynchronous Notifications**: Implement Celery for background task processing.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Use WebSockets for real-time updates on dashboards.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Use frontend frameworks like React or Vue.js to improve user experience.
- **Containerization**: Add Docker support for containerized deployment.
